# Project-Recursion

We spent some time early on dealing with sorting (e.g. bubble sort). Now it’s time to take another look at sorting with Merge Sort, a type of sort that lends itself well to recursion and can be much faster than bubble sort on the right data sets. You’ll build a method which sorts a given array but uses a “merge sort” method for doing so.
